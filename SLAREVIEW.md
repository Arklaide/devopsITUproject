# Devops Group I - SLA review
It seems like they have a solid SLA, they describe some of the key numbers of their application (response time, uptime) and what happens in the process of failures. Even to the point of 0.1% uptime there is a compensation which might lead to a pretty big compensation to give out to customers using the application.
## Failure frequency
Since its now really precise what is meant by the first few weeks, this can perhaps be used to never give compensation, And also compensating 5 USD 
## Testing the Compensation
We've decided to write to them and see if their claim of response within 3 days is true.
